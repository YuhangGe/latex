The IEEEtrantools.sty package provides several commands from the
IEEEtran.cls file so that they can be used under other LaTeX classes. The
user guide provided here covers only the differences in the use of the
commands from those provided by IEEEtran.cls. For complete documentation
on these commands, see the relevant sections in the IEEEtran_HOWTO manual
of the IEEEtran LaTeX class, specifically the section covering IEEE-style
lists and the Appendix covering the IEEEeqnarray commands.

The IEEEtrantools.sty package provides the following IEEEtran.cls commands:

 1. \IEEEPARstart which produces large initial "drop cap" letters.

 2. the \bstctlcite command for the control entry types of IEEEtran.bst
    V1.00 and later

 3. the IEEE itemize, enumerate and description list environments

 4. the complete IEEEeqnarray family for producing multiline equations
    as well as matrices and tables, including the IEEEeqnarray support
    commands.

 5. The IEEEproof environment.
 
 6. \IEEEauthorrefmark{}

IEEEtrantools.sty is not needed and should not be used with IEEEtran.cls.

*******
12/2012 V1.3 (V1.8 of IEEEtran.cls) changes:

 1) No longer redefines the standard LaTeX itemize, enumerate and 
    description (IED) lists by default. (e.g., the older package option
    "retainorgcmds" is now the default behavior.) A new package option,
    "redeflists", can be invoked to redefine the standard IED list
    environments to their IEEE versions. IEEEitemize, IEEEenumerate and
    IEEEdescription remain available in any case. The redeflists option
    may not be compatible with other packages that alter the standard
    IED list environments.

 2) Added new *-forms of \IEEEyesnumber*, \IEEEnonumber*, \IEEEyessubnumber*,
    and \IEEEnosubnumber* (the non-star form of the latter is also new) which
    persist across IEEEeqnarray lines until countermanded. To provide for
    continued subequations across instances of IEEEeqnarrays as well as for
    subequations that follow a main equation (e.g., 14, 14a, 14b ...)
    \IEEEyessubnumber no longer automatically increments the equation number
    on it's first invocation of a subequation group. Invoke both
    \IEEEyesnumber\IEEEyessubnumber together to start a new
    equation/subequation group.

 3) Hyperref links now work with IEEEeqnarray equations.
    Thanks to Stefan M. Moser for reporting this problem.

 4) Now provides the IEEEproof environment, as well as the
    \IEEEQEDhere, \IEEEQEDhereeqn and \IEEEQEDoff commands.
    Also, \IEEEproofindentspace allows users to change the
    IEEEproof indentation via \renewcommand.
    Thanks to Mark D. Butala, Hennadiy Leontyev and Stefan M. Moser
    for suggesting this. Special thanks to Stefan M. Moser for beta
    testing and additional suggestions which improved IEEEproof.

 5) Revised \IEEEeqnarraymulticol{} to allow inner alignments without
    requiring extra containing braces to prevent an incomplete \ifx error.
    Thanks to Stefan M. Moser and Auke van der Valk for reporting this
    problem.

 6) Added \IEEEauthorrefmark.

 7) Removed support for legacy IED list commands.
    IEEEtrantools no longer defines or references \labelindent so as to
    avoid namespace problems with list packages that define it.
    Thanks to Sven Köhler for reporting the problem with enumitem.sty.
